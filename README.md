# README #

The main component of this project is a Mudlet profile (Lua script).  You need to install Mudlet to use it.
The bot also uses IRC to provide a means to monitor the server remotely as well as command the bot and talk to players.  Mudlet requires editing with a hex editor before you can do that as it is hardcoded to connect to the official Mudlet support channel and the bot is coded to not work with irc if that has not been changed.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Contributors are always welcome.  The bot needs more admin commands, more and better reporting, more things for players to do and if possible the replacement of Mudlet with a better engine and its built-in, very basic irc support with a full irc client/server.
* All code submissions will be checked and tested before inclusion.  You can always fork the project and make a better bot :)
